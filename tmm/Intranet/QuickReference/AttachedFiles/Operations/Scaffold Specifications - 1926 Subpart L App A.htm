      <P class=BLOCK1>This Appendix provides non-mandatory guidelines to assist 
      employers in complying with the requirements of subpart L of this part. An 
      employer may use these guidelines and tables as a starting point for 
      designing scaffold systems. However, the guidelines do not provide all the 
      information necessary to build a complete system, and the employer is 
      still responsible for designing and assembling these components in such a 
      way that the completed system will meet the requirements of 1926.451(a). 
      Scaffold components which are not selected and loaded in accordance with 
      this Appendix, and components for which no specific guidelines or tables 
      are given in this Appendix (e.g., joints, ties, components for wood pole 
      scaffolds more than 60 feet in height, components for heavy-duty horse 
      scaffolds, components made with other materials, and components with other 
      dimensions, etc.) must be designed and constructed in accordance with the 
      capacity requirements of 1926.451(a), and loaded in accordance with 
      1926.451(d)(1).</P><PRE>Index to Appendix A for Subpart L

      <P class=BLOCK1>1. General Guidelines and Tables</P>
      <P class=BLOCK1>(a) The following tables, and the tables in Part 2 -- 
      Specific guidelines and tables, assume that all load-carrying timber 
      members (except planks) of the scaffold are a minimum of 1,500 lb-f/in(2) 
      (stress grade) construction grade lumber. All dimensions are nominal sizes 
      as provided in the American Softwood Lumber Standards, dated January 1970, 
      except that, where rough sizes are noted, only rough or undressed lumber 
      of the size specified will satisfy minimum requirements.</P>
      <P class=BLOCK1>(b) Solid sawn wood used as scaffold planks shall be 
      selected for such use following the grading rules established by a 
      recognized lumber grading association or by an independent lumber grading 
      inspection agency. Such planks shall be identified by the grade stamp of 
      such association or agency. The association or agency and the grading 
      rules under which the wood is graded shall be certified by the Board of 
      Review, American Lumber Standard Committee, as set forth in the American 
      Softwood Lumber Standard of the U.S. Department of Commerce.</P>
      <P class=BLOCK1>(i) Allowable spans shall be determined in compliance with 
      the National Design Specification for Wood Construction published by the 
      National Forest Products Association; paragraph 5 of ANSI A10.8-1988 
      Scaffolding-Safety Requirements published by the American National 
      Standards Institute; or for 2 x 10 inch (nominal) or 2 x 9 inch (rough) 
      solid sawn wood planks, as shown in the following table:</P><PRE>_______________________________________________

      lb/ft.(2) shall be 4 feet.</P>
      <P class=BLOCK1>(c) Fabricated planks and platforms may be used in lieu of 
      solid sawn wood planks. Maximum spans for such units shall be as 
      recommended by the manufacturer based on the maximum intended load being 
      calculated as follows:</P><PRE>_____________________________________________________________________

      which the upper wire rope sheaves or suspension points are closer to the 
      plane of the building face than the corresponding attachment points on the 
      platform, thus causing the platform to press against the face of the 
      building. Static lines are separate ropes secured at their top and bottom 
      ends closer to the plane of the building face than the outermost edge of 
      the platform. By drawing the static line taut, the platform is drawn 
      against the face of the building.</P>
